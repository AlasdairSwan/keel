  <h1>Backbone Architecture Demo</h1>
  <p>An example of a preferred Backbone.js architecture.</p>
  <p>This example includes both compiled and uncompiled versions (before and after the grunt (v0.4) build is run:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="src">Uncompiled Source</a></li>
    <li><a href="dist">Compiled Distribution</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: If your web root is this directory, the links above should work. If this <code>backbone-arch-demo</code> is a subdirectory of your web root, changing line 14 of <code>/src/app/app.js</code> to <code>root: "/backbone-arch-demo/src/"</code> should make the uncompiled source work (if this is multiple levels below the web root, all of those levels must be included). Running grunt (assuming it is installed) in the directory will build this change out to the compiled distribution, which should then work as well.</p>
  <p>The purpose, however, is not to look at how beautiful this site is, but read the source code, which can be downloaded in its entirety at <a href="https://github.com/bobholt/backbone-arch-demo">https://github.com/bobholt/backbone-arch-demo</a>.</p>
