  <h1>Backbone Architecture Demo</h1>
  <p>An example of a preferred Backbone.js architecture.</p>
  <p>This example includes both compiled and uncompiled versions (before and after the grunt (v0.4) build is run:</p>
  <p>Note: If your web root is this directory, you should see content underneath the double line below. If this <code>backbone-arch-demo</code> folder is a subdirectory of your web root, changing line 14 of <code>/src/app/app.js</code> to: </p>
  <p><code>root: "/backbone-arch-demo/src/"</code></p>
  <p>should make the uncompiled source work (if this is multiple levels below the web root, all levels preceding /backbone-arch-demo/ must also be included). Running grunt (assuming it is installed) in the directory will build this change out to the compiled distribution, which should then work as well.</p>
  <p>The purpose, however, is not to look at how beautiful this site is, but read the source code, which can be downloaded in its entirety at <a href="https://github.com/bobholt/backbone-arch-demo">https://github.com/bobholt/backbone-arch-demo</a>.</p>
